Rock Paper Scissors game with JavaScript involves three parts:

HTML Structure: This creates the buttons for player input and areas to display scores and messages.
CSS Styling (Optional): This enhances the look of the buttons, scores, and messages.
JavaScript Logic: This handles player interaction, computer choice generation, and determining the winner.
Here's a simplified breakdown of the JavaScript logic:

Variables: Create variables to track player score, computer score, and total rounds.
Functions:
getPlayerChoice(): This function captures the player's choice (rock, paper, scissors) based on button clicks (using DOM manipulation).
getComputerChoice(): This function randomly generates the computer's choice (rock, paper, scissors) using Math.random().
playRound(playerChoice, computerChoice): This function compares the choices and determines the winner using conditional statements (e.g., rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, etc.). It updates the scores accordingly.
gameOver(): This function (optional) checks if the total rounds are played and displays the final winner.
Putting it Together:

The main game loop might call getPlayerChoice(), then getComputerChoice(), and finally playRound() to determine the round winner and update scores. It can repeat this loop for a set number of rounds before calling gameOver().

Additional Features:

Display the player's and computer's choices for each round.
Add visual feedback for wins, losses, and ties.
Implement a reset button to start a new game.
